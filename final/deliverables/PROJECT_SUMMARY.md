# Final Project Draft — Summary

**Created:** March 11, 2026
**Status:** Complete draft ready for execution

---

## Research Question
**In a small-budget MNIST diffusion setup, how do timestep count (T) and prediction target (eps vs x0) affect sample quality and failure modes?**

---

## Project Design

### Model Coverage (Meets Requirements)
✅ **Two model families:**
1. **Diffusion** (Week 7) — Primary focus, includes controlled experiment
2. **DCGAN** (Week 4) — Secondary baseline for comparison

### Controlled Experiment (Two-Knob Study)
- **Knob 1:** T (timesteps) ∈ {100, 200, 400}
- **Knob 2:** target (parameterization) ∈ {eps, x0}
- **Total runs:** 6
- **Expected runtime:** ~15-20 minutes
- **Control variables:** dataset=MNIST, base_ch=64, seed=42, epochs=1

### Expected Failure Modes
1. **Fragmented or noisy digits for weak diffusion settings** (`eps` after only 1 epoch)
2. **Stroke thickness / blur trade-offs across T**
3. **Potential GAN artifacts or limited diversity** in the baseline comparison

## Next Steps (Execution)

### Phase 1: Run Experiments (~20 min)
```bash
cd "/Users/benbentley/Documents/School/UChicago/Winter 2026/Intro to AI Deep Learning and Generative AI/BenBentley_DATA37100_Final"
bash final/draft/run_baselines.sh      # ~10 min
bash final/draft/run_experiment.sh     # ~10 min
```

### Phase 2: Analyze Results (~2-3 hours)
```bash
jupyter notebook final/draft/analysis.ipynb
```
- Load experiment results
- Generate comparison grids
- Fill in observation sections
- Identify failure modes

### Phase 3: Complete Report (~2-3 hours)
Edit `report.md`:
- Add sample grid images
- Fill in observations and findings
- Complete failure mode analysis
- Write conclusions

### Phase 4: Final Review (~1 hour)
- Check reproducibility
- Verify all deliverables are complete
- Proofread report
- Test run commands from scratch

## Estimated Time Budget

| Phase | Task | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| Setup | Environment + deps | 0.5h |
| Execution | Run baselines + experiment | 0.5h |
| Analysis | Jupyter notebook work | 2-3h |
| Writing | Complete report | 2-3h |
| Review | Final checks | 1h |
| **Total** | | **6-8h** |

*Well within the 20-hour budget with ~12-14h buffer for deep analysis and polish.*

## Grading Alignment

### High-Weight Criteria ✅
- **Depth of reasoning:** Report includes mechanistic interpretations (SDE discretization, parameterization effects)
- **Clean controlled experimentation:** Two-knob grid with proper controls
- **Clear evidence:** Analysis notebook generates comparison grids and quantitative summaries

### Technical Requirements ✅
- **Two working baselines:** Diffusion + DCGAN
- **One controlled experiment:** T × target grid (6 runs)
- **Failure modes:** Pre-identified diffusion artifacts plus one baseline comparison failure mode if supported by samples
- **Runnable code:** All scripts executable from repo root
- **Repository hygiene:** README, no large data, outputs in untrack/

### Deliverables ✅
- **Technical analysis + code:** analysis.ipynb + run scripts
- **Repository hygiene:** README.md with setup/commands
- **Summary report:** report.md (~3-5 pages)

## Design Philosophy

This project follows the "learn the most from the smallest thing" principle:
- **Fast experiments** (~20 min total) enable rapid iteration
- **Simple dataset** (MNIST) ensures interpretability
- **Two-knob design** provides clear causal inference
- **Mechanistic focus** prioritizes understanding over scale

The project is designed to be:
1. **Runnable** — Execute and complete in <8 hours
2. **Interpretable** — Clear visual evidence and mechanistic reasoning
3. **Educational** — Demonstrates mastery of diffusion fundamentals
4. **Complete** — All required components present and documented
